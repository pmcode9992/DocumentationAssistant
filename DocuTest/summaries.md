's own ship on the game board.

### Own_ship

```
# Place holder for player's own ship on game board
```

This section of code is responsible for declaring and initializing the constant variable "Own_ship" which represents the player's own ship on the game board. This variable is used throughout the code to keep track of the player's ship and its position on the game board. 



### Importing Libraries

The next chunk of code imports necessary libraries for the game. The logging library allows for error and information logging, the socket library allows for socket connections, the struct library allows for packing and unpacking data, the subprocess library allows for starting new processes and managing input/output/error pipes, and the dataclasses library allows for creating data structures without writing boilerplate code. Additionally, the color, background, and cursor libraries are imported to modify the appearance of the output text.

### Game Setup

This chunk of code sets up the game board by defining a constant variable for the vertical header and a list of fields that can appear on the board. The different types of fields are also defined as constant variables. Lastly, the supported ship types and their corresponding names are defined, along with a list of ships that the player will have in their fleet. These values can be modified according to the needs of the game.




### Class Error(ValueError)

```
logging.error(str(self))
super().__init__(*args)
```

The `Error` class is a subclass of the built-in `ValueError` class. It is used to handle errors and log them using the `logging` module. The `__init__` function overrides the superclass's `__init__` function and calls the `logging.error` function to log the error message. It then calls the superclass's `__init__` function to handle the error. 

### Function print_err(*args, **kwargs)

```
print(Text.RED, *args, Cursor.FULL_RESET, **kwargs)
```

The `print_err` function is used to print out error messages in a specific color. It takes in any number of arguments and keyword arguments and prints them out using the `print` function from the `color` module. The `Text.RED` and `Cursor.FULL_RESET` are used to set the color of the text to red and reset the cursor to its original position. 

### Function coord_valid(c: int)

```
return 0 <= c <= 9
```

The `coord_valid` function is used to check if a given coordinate is valid on the game board. It takes


class Shot:
    x: int
    y: int


### Create Empty Board

This function creates an empty game board by returning a list of lists with 10 rows and 10 columns, each containing a value of 0. This function is used to initialize the game board before the game starts.

### Update Player Board

This function takes in a shot and the game board as parameters and updates the player's game board based on the result of the shot. It checks the coordinates of the shot and if it hits the player's own ship, the corresponding field on the board is changed to indicate that the ship has been hit. If the shot misses, nothing happens. This function returns a boolean value indicating whether the shot was successful or not.

### Update Enemy Board

Similar to the previous function, this function also takes in a shot and the game board as parameters. It updates the enemy's game board based on the result of the shot. If the shot hits the enemy's ship, the corresponding field on the board is changed to indicate a hit. Otherwise, the field is changed to indicate a miss.

### Player Lost

This function checks the player's game board to see if they have lost the game. It does this by checking if there are any

 

### Shot Class

The Shot class is responsible for handling shots taken by the player on the game board. It contains two attributes, x and y, which represent the coordinates of the shot. The attribute last_shot_hit is set to False by default and is used to keep track of whether the last shot was a hit or not.

The __bytes__ method is used to convert the shot coordinates and hit status into a byte representation. This is done using the struct.pack function which packs the data in a specific format. Before packing, the x and y coordinates are checked to ensure they are not too large to fit into 4 bits, as specified in the game rules. If they are too large, an Error is raised.

The @staticmethod decode function is used to unpack the byte representation of a shot into its original x and y coordinates, as well as the hit status. This is done using the struct.unpack function, which unpacks the data according to the specified format. The x and y coordinates are then extracted using bitwise operations.

Overall, the Shot class is an essential component of the game as it handles the conversion of shot data into bytes and vice versa. It also ensures that the shot coordinates are within the allowed range to prevent any errors during gameplay.



    def recv(self):
        if self.is_server:
            return self._server_recv()
        return self._client_recv()

### Network Class

The `Network` class is responsible for creating a network connection between players in the game. It has a constant variable `BUFSIZE` which defines the maximum size of data that can be sent or received at one time. 

In the `__init__` method, the `Network` class takes in parameters `host`, `port`, and `is_server` to determine whether it is setting up as a server or a client. If it is a server, it creates a new socket and binds it to the specified `host` and `port`. If it is a client, it connects to the remote host using the socket. 

The `send` method is responsible for sending data over the network. It checks whether the `Network` is set up as a server or a client, and then calls the appropriate method `_server_send` or `_client_send`. 

The `recv` method is responsible for receiving data over the network. It also checks whether the `Network` is set up as a server or a client, and then calls the appropriate method `_server_recv` or `_client_recv`. 

The `_server



### Socket and Subprocess

The code above uses the imported libraries of socket and subprocess to create a socket connection and receive data from the connection. The code starts by logging that it is waiting for data and then enters a while loop to continuously check for and receive data from the connection. Once data is received, it is returned.

The code then defines the function _client_recv(), which uses the socket library to receive data from the connection. This function is then used in the recv() function, which checks if the code is running as a server or a client and calls the appropriate function. If an exception occurs while receiving data, the close() function is called to close the socket connection.

The close() function closes the socket connection and also checks if there is a connection variable and closes it as well if it exists.

The code also utilizes the __enter__() and __exit__() functions, which enable the use of the context manager. This allows for better handling of errors and ensures that the socket connection is closed properly.



### pre_process_string

This function takes in a string and performs several operations to pre-process it before further use. Firstly, it converts the string to lowercase to make it easier to work with. Then, it defines a function called 'wanted' which checks if a character is alphanumeric, a dash, or has an ordinal value between 'a' and 'k'. This function is used to filter out any unwanted characters from the string.

Next, a list of ASCII characters is created and a filter is applied using the 'wanted' function, which removes any unwanted characters from the list. Then, the original string is encoded into ASCII format with any errors being ignored and then decoded back into a string using the filtered ASCII characters.

Finally, the pre-processed string is returned. This function is useful for cleaning up user input and making it easier to work with in the code.

### parse_shot

This function takes in a string and parses it to extract the coordinates for a shot in a game. The string is first pre-processed using the 'pre_process_string' function to remove any unwanted characters and make it easier to work with.

Then, the string is converted to lowercase and all spaces are removed. The first character is converted to its corresponding numerical value between 0 and




### ask_player_for_shot()

This function asks the player for a shot on their turn by prompting them to input the coordinates in the format of XY (e.g. A4). It then uses the parse_shot function to validate the input and returns the coordinates. If there is an error in the input, it will continue to ask the player until a valid input is entered.


### ask_player_for_ship(ship_type)

This function asks the player to place their ship on the game board in the format of XX - YY (e.g. A1-A5). It then uses the parse_shot function to validate the input and ensures that the ship is placed either vertically or horizontally. It also checks for any out of bounds coordinates and ensures that the ship is the correct length for the given ship type. Once all validation is passed, the function returns the coordinates of the ship.



### Function: place_ship(a, b, board)
This function takes in two coordinates (a and b) and a game board as parameters. It first checks if the two coordinates are not diagonal to each other, and if they are, it raises an error. Then, it checks if the two coordinates are not the same, and if they are, it raises an error. Otherwise, it iterates over the squares between the two coordinates and checks if they are empty. If not, it raises an error. If they are empty, the function places the player's ship on the game board by updating the corresponding squares with the constant variable OWN_SHIP. Once the ship is placed, the function returns.

### Function: place_ships(board, enemy_board)
This function takes in two game boards (one for the player and one for the enemy) as parameters. It iterates through the list of player ships, asking the player for coordinates to place each ship. It then calls the place_ship function and breaks out of the loop once the ship is successfully placed. If there is an error, the function will print an error message.
