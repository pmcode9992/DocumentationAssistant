## Battleship

The project is a Battleship game implemented in Python. It includes functionalities such as creating and updating game boards, placing ships on the board, shooting at enemy ships, and checking for a player's loss. The project also includes networking capabilities for communication between players. Technologies used include Python's socket module for networking and dataclasses for defining data structures. The project aims to provide a fun and interactive Battleship game experience for players.

#decisiontree.py



# battleship.py

This is a Python module for a game of battleship. It includes various functions and classes for managing the game, such as creating boards, managing player input, and handling network communication.

## create_board()

The `create_board()` function creates a game board for the player and enemy. It initializes a 10x10 board with empty cells and randomly places ships on the board.

## update_player_board()

The `update_player_board()` function updates the player's board with shots fired by the enemy. It takes in the coordinates of the shot and marks the corresponding cell as either a hit or a miss.

## update_enemy_board()

The `update_enemy_board()` function updates the enemy's board with shots fired by the player. It takes in the coordinates of the shot and marks the corresponding cell as either a hit or a miss.

## check_loss()

The `check_loss()` function checks if the player has lost the game by checking if all their ships have been sunk. If so, it returns a boolean value of True.

## manage_network()

The `manage_network()` function handles network communication between players in a multiplayer game. It sends and receives data using sockets, allowing players to take turns firing shots at each other's boards.

## class Shot
The `Shot` class represents a shot fired by a player in the game of battleship. It contains information about the coordinates of the shot and whether it was a hit or a miss.

### x, y, last_shot_hit attributes
The `x` and `y` attributes store the coordinates of the shot. They are represented as integers and are used to determine the location of the shot on the game board. The `last_shot_hit` attribute is a boolean value that indicates whether the shot was a hit (True) or a miss (False).

### __bytes__() method
The `__bytes__()` method converts the `Shot` object into a byte string that can be sent over a network. It first checks if the coordinates are within the range of 4 bits, as specified by the game rules. If the coordinates are too large, an `Error` is raised. Then, it uses the `struct` module to pack the coordinates and the hit/miss information into a byte string.

### decode() static method
The `decode()` static method takes in a byte string and converts it back into a `Shot` object. It uses the `struct` module to unpack the byte string and retrieve

## Class Network
The `Network` class handles network communication between players in a multiplayer game of battleship. It has attributes and methods for creating a socket, sending and receiving data, and managing connections between players.

### BUFSIZE attribute
The `BUFSIZE` attribute is used to specify the size of the buffer when sending or receiving data over the network. It is set to a value of 16, which is the maximum number of bytes that can be sent or received at once.

### __init__() method
The `__init__()` method initializes a `Network` object with the specified host and port number. It also takes in a boolean value `is_server` to indicate whether the current player is a server or a client. If `is_server` is True, the socket is created and bound to the given host and port, and the server starts listening for connections. If `is_server` is False, the socket connects to the remote host specified by the host and port.

### send() method
The `send()` method is used to send data over the network. It takes in a byte string `pkt` and uses the appropriate send method depending on whether the player is a server or a client. If the player

# parse_shot(s) (third-level heading)

The `parse_shot()` function takes in a string `s` and converts it into coordinates for a shot in the game of battleship. It first preprocesses the string by removing any spaces and converting it to lowercase. Then, it checks if the string is at least two characters long. If not, an error is raised.

Next, the function tries to convert the first character (representing the x coordinate) into a number between 0 and 9 by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' (97) from the ordinal value of the character. The second character (representing the y coordinate) is converted into an integer. If the conversion fails, an error is raised.

Then, the function checks if the x and y coordinates are within the range of 0 to 9. If not, errors are raised. Finally, the function returns the x and y coordinates, along with a boolean value indicating whether the shot was a hit or a miss.

# ask_player_for_shot() (third-level heading)

The `ask_player_for_shot()` function prompts the player to enter a shot in the format XY (e.g. A4) and uses the `parse_shot()`
