## Function: SetupGame()
Explanation: This function is responsible for setting up the game boards for both the player and the enemy. It creates the game boards using nested lists and populates them with empty cells denoted by the '~' character. It also initializes variables for keeping track of the number of ships and their respective sizes. This function is called at the beginning of the game to set up the boards before gameplay begins.

## Function: HandleShot()
Explanation: This function handles the logic for player and enemy shots. It prompts the player to input a coordinate for their shot and checks if it is a valid input. If the shot hits a ship, it updates the game board to show a hit using the 'X' character. If the shot misses, it updates the board to show a miss using the 'O' character. This function also checks for wins or losses by counting the number of remaining ships on the board.

## Function: PlaceShip()
Explanation: This function is responsible for managing the placement of ships on the game board. It prompts the player to input the starting coordinate and direction for the ship, then checks if the placement is valid. If the placement is valid, it updates the game board to show the ship using the 'S' character. If



## import logging
Explanation: This import statement brings in the logging module, which allows for logging information, warnings, and errors during program execution. This can be helpful for debugging and monitoring code performance.

## import socket
Explanation: This import statement brings in the socket module, which provides access to networking capabilities such as creating and connecting to sockets, sending and receiving data over network connections, and managing network interfaces.

## import struct
Explanation: This import statement brings in the struct module, which provides functions for converting between Python values and C structs, which are fixed-length binary data structures. This can be useful for network programming and low-level binary data manipulation.

## import subprocess as sp
Explanation: This import statement brings in the subprocess module, which allows for spawning new processes, connecting to their input/output/error pipes, and obtaining their return codes. This can be useful for running external programs or scripts within a Python script.

## from dataclasses import dataclass
Explanation: This import statement brings in the dataclass decorator from the dataclasses module. This decorator allows for creating classes with automatically generated methods such as __init__, __repr__, and __eq__ based on the class attributes. This can make working with data objects more convenient and efficient.

## from itertools import repeat




## class Error(ValueError)
Explanation: This class is a subclass of the built-in ValueError class. It overrides the __init__ method to log any exceptions to a log file using the logging module. This allows for better error tracking and debugging during program execution.

## def print_err(*args, **kwargs)
Explanation: This function prints an error message in red using ANSI color codes. It is used for formatting error messages in a visually distinct way and can be called with any number of arguments.

## def coord_valid(c: int)
Explanation: This function checks if a given x or y coordinate is within the bounds of the game board. It takes in a single integer argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the coordinate is valid or not.

## def print_boards(board, enemy_board)
Explanation: This function prints the game boards for the player and enemy side by side, using ANSI color codes to differentiate between different cell values. It takes in two nested lists representing the game boards and prints them in a visually appealing format.

## def create_empty_board()
Explanation: This function creates an empty game board by returning a nested list with 10 rows and 10 columns, filled with zeros. This board can then be populated with ship locations and shots.

## Function: pre_process_string(s)
Explanation: This function takes in a string and converts it to lowercase. It then defines a function called wanted that checks if the character is alphanumeric, a hyphen, or within the range of "a" and "k" in terms of ASCII code. It then creates a list of ASCII characters and uses the wanted function to filter out unwanted characters. Finally, it encodes the string to ASCII, ignoring any errors, and then translates it using the filtered ASCII code point list, effectively removing any unwanted characters.

## Function: parse_shot(s)
Explanation: This function takes in a string and preprocesses it using the pre_process_string function. It then converts the string to lowercase and removes any spaces. If the length of the string is less than 2, it raises an error. The function then tries to convert the first character to a number between 0 and 9, and the second character to an integer. If any errors occur, it raises an error. It then checks if the coordinates are within the bounds of the game board and returns the coordinates in the form of (x, y, False).

## Function: ask_player_for_shot()
Explanation: This function prompts the player to input a shot in the format of XY



## Function: place_ship(a, b, board)
Explanation: This function updates the game board and places a ship on it. It takes in two tuples representing the starting and ending coordinates of the ship, as well as the game board to update. The function first unpacks the tuples into individual variables for easier manipulation. It then checks if the ship is being placed diagonally or if it has only one square, and raises an error if either is the case. 

The function then iterates over the squares between the starting and ending coordinates, checking if each square is already occupied by another ship. If not, it updates the square to show the player's ship using the 'S' character. The function also handles cases where the ship is placed horizontally or vertically, by incrementing or decrementing the x or y coordinate depending on the direction of the ship.

## Function: place_ships(board, enemy_board)
Explanation: This function is responsible for placing all of the player's ships on the game board. It takes in the player's board and the enemy's board as parameters. It uses a for loop to iterate through the list of player ships and prompts the player to input the starting and ending coordinates for each ship. It then calls the place_ship function to update
